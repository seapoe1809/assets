README INSTALL PYTHON 3.11 from SOURCE FOR LINUX
Install Python 3.11 from source, you can follow these steps on a Linux-based system.
1. First, install some required packages:

         sudo apt update
         sudo apt install -y build-essential zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libssl-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev wget libbz2-dev libsqlite3-dev

2. Download the Python source code:

         wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.0/Python-3.11.0.tgz

3. Extract the downloaded package:

         tar -xvf Python-3.11.0.tgz

4. Change directory into the Python source folder:

         cd Python-3.11.0

5. Configure the build process:

         ./configure --enable-optimizations

6. Compile:

         make -j 4  # Replace 4 with the number of cores you want to allocate for the build process

9. Install Python: Note: Using altinstall prevents this version of Python from conflicting with the system version. You'll invoke this version specifically as python3.11.

        sudo make altinstall


10. After the installation process is complete, you can verify the Python version by running:

        python3.11 --version

If everything was successful, it should return Python 3.11.0. After installation, you might want to symlink python3.11 as python3 if you want it to be the default Python 3 version:
11. Symlink python3

        sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/python3.11 /usr/local/bin/python3

Caution: This will change the default python3 to point to python3.11. Make sure you know what you're doing as this can affect other applications that depend on python3.
